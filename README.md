Analysis of police-recored offences by NUTS 3 regions in the EU from 2008 to 2022

## Description ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Crime analysis is a critical feature of modern policing strategies that is a form of proactive problem-solving and intelligence-led decision-making. Identifying trends and patterns overall, as well as within crime categories and regions, allow the police an effective resource allocation. Comparing different countries and regions in Europe may be used to evaluate effectiveness of policing and may foster collaborations to improve strategies in policing. 
As a civilian, this information can be useful for traveling or residential purposes. Being aware of a higher risk of crime, or a specific type of crime can help prevent crimes and becoming a victim of a crime.
