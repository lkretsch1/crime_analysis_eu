# Analyzing Crimes in the EU
Analysis of police-recored offences by NUTS 3 regions in the EU from 2008 to 2022

## Introduction ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Crime analysis is a critical feature of modern policing strategies that is a form of proactive problem-solving and intelligence-led decision-making. Identifying trends and patterns overall, as well as within crime categories and regions, allow the police an effective resource allocation. Comparing different countries and regions in Europe may be used to evaluate effectiveness of policing and may foster collaborations to improve strategies in policing. 
As a civilian, this information can be useful for traveling or residential purposes. Being aware of a higher risk of crime, or a specific type of crime can help prevent crimes and becoming a victim of a crime.   

## Streamlit App üì±

Link to Streamlit App 
https://crimeanalysis-eu.streamlit.app/

The streamlit app can be opened by running the app.py file as well. 

## Data/operation abstraction design üåê

The data with police recorded offenses has been retrieved from:  https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/wzxbhifltwvee4h8tcdza?locale=en#
Different file formats are available for download. Using the csv file provides a cleaned and correctly formatted dataframe for the analysis. 

In order to transform geo codes in the crime dataset into region names, the data dictionary has been copied in an excel file by hand since no fitting dataset has been found.  
In addition to that, a shape file containing the locations of NUTS-Regions has been downloaded from the following page:

## Future Work üöÄ

The streamlit app works with data from 2008 to 2022. More recent data and more information about crimes would allow for a more accurate analysis. A possible extension of this app would be the incorporation of additional datasets, such as datasets about police resource allocation. Information on date and time of the reported offense would open the possibility to analyze crimes even further.
